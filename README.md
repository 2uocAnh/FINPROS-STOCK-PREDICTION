# Stock Price Prediction and Analysis

This repository contains code for analyzing and predicting stock prices using historical data. The project focuses on four stocks: **FPT**, **MSN**, **PNJ**, and **VIC**. The analysis includes data preprocessing, visualization, and basic prediction using **LSTM** (Long Short-Term Memory) models.

- **Data preprocessing**
- **Visualization** of stock trends
- Building **LSTM models** for price prediction.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing stock data for analysis.
- **Visualization**: Plotting stock price trends over time.
- **LSTM Model**: Building and training an LSTM model for stock price prediction.
- **Analysis**: Insights into stock price movements and trends.
